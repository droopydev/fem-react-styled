### 🤔 What is Frontendmentor?

Frontendmentor is a platform that provides front-end challenges to solve. Challenges are categories into different levels of difficulties (newbie, junior, intermediate, advanced, and guru). Each challenge are provided with a set of resources (style guide, optimized images ) to kickstart the process.

This is my second attempt at FEMentor. I previously attempted some of the challenges using only vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

What I like about FEMentor is that as developers wanting to practise and try out new technologies, we tend to get stuck in thinking of a project idea. FEMentor eliminates that by providing the idea and resources, just as how we might receive design specs from a designer on the job.
