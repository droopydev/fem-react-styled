# Newbie01 - Order Summary Component

![Screenshot of Challenge](./src/assets/readme-cover.png)

This challenge was my first attempt developing with the ReactStyled stack that I had planned for. It took me awhile to set the project up as I was trying out a number of new stuffs. First was setting up the monorepo with NX, and second was understanding how to build UI components with the CDD approach using Storybook.js . For more info on this approach, check out the root project README.

Instead of my usual process of developing UI (SASS with BEM approach), I find myself spending extra time thinking of how I would built the button component. Thoughts such as what props would it recieve, should I split the button variants into two componets (TextButton, SolidButton), or combine into one.

## üß† What I Learned

  <br/>

## üßó Challenges Faced

- Reading and understanding how existing Design System built their Button components. There were a lot of terminology and methods that I find hard to comprehend.
- Time Management.
- Remembering the token naming that I wrote myself.
